## What is 'Yoan and Donuts'
A simple experiment made with ThreeJS !
(My first one actually 😁)
The experience is hosted here [https://yoan-and-donuts.vercel.app](https://yoan-and-donuts.vercel.app)

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run the followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

## Thanks
Thanks for reading this far ! <br />
This experiment was made possible by [Three.js journey by Bruno Simon](https://threejs-journey.com) 🎉 <br />
I'm still learning Three.js and I hope I can make beautiful websites soon !
